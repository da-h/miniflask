# Predefined Modules
MiniFlask comes with some simple Modules (that can be included at any time)


# Modules
Yes, the first module is called `modules`.
It simply lists all available modules in a directory.

# Events
This module shows all registered events of all available modules.

# Info
Calls `modules` and then `events`.  
(Finishes the program afterwards.)
